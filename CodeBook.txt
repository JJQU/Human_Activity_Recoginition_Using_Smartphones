CODEBOOK

Introduction

This codeboook is created as part of Peer-Graded Assignment for course Getting and Cleaning Data instructed by Jeff Leek from Johns Hopkins University.
This codebook provides a description of raw data, tidy data, and transformations that are performed to clean up the data. 

Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset

The experiments had carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within the age range from 19 to 48 years old. 
The data were collected from Samsung Galaxy S II smartphone that each volunteer wore on his/her waist.
Each volunteer performed six activities while wearing the smartphone. 
The collected data was then splited into two sets, train and test. 
The train set contains 70% of the data from 21 volunteers. The test set contains 30% of the data from 9 volunteers.
The experiment used embedded accelerometer and gyroscope to capture 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz

Data Processing:
1. set working directory
2.download file from the url for the project
3.unzip the file
4.load features and activity lables
5. load train datasets
a.load X_train and assign feature name to each column
b.load y_train
c.load subject_train
d.combine a.b.c to create a train dataset
6.load test datasets
a.load X_test and assign feature name to each column
b.load y_test
c.load subject_test
d. combine a.b.c to create a test dataset
7.merge two data sets together to create one data set
8. extracted only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
9.uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
10. appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
